GL4Java & Swing using Offscreen-Rendering
=========================================

The demos are located in:
	demos/GLSwingDemos

Start the demos with:
	java GLSwingDemoApplet
	java InternalGLFrameDemo1 

Status:
=======

Using Offscreen OpenGL rendering,
if true overlapping Swing components are needed !

Otherwise, please use the normal GLCanvas,
because of fast direct rendering !

The future X11 implementation should respect GLX Version 1.3
with its PBuffer, which uses the direct rendering (-> hardware acceleration).

The future Win32 implementation should find a way to use the
hardware accelerated offscreen rendering !

All other suggestions failed while testing.
Tests for the other ways are still exists in the test directory !

Suggestions are wellcome !
