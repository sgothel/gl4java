I encourage you te read these files carefully
and also to read the html/pdf documentation as well,
befor asking !

You may want to add yourself to the GL4Java mailinglist !

I would be very lucky, if i get some response, critic, inspirations,
bugfixes and participation.

I changed (see CHANGES) the naming convention for a better 
transparence and porting-ability (sorry for my english)
- so i changed the lib-name to GL4Java !

<Please forgive me for so many I's :>

The following Unices were succesfully testes:

	o Linux (x86) 2.X
	o SunOS (Sparc) 5.X
	o AIX 4.2 (RS/6000)
	o SGI Irix

	o Macintosh (check http://www.jausoft.com/gl4java.html)
	o Windows NT 95/98 (x86) 4.0 (sun/netscape)
	o Windows NT 95/98 (x86) 4.0 (msjvm/ie40)

May be - WE can find a way for a standard OpenGL for Java API !

As you can see, OpenGL-Rendering can be integrated in Java-Programs
very well. You can use the normal java paint and event - functions
as you used display and reshape in glut !
