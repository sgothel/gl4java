All about the GL4Java Version Numbers
=====================================

The GL4Java version-string is X.Y.Z.R:
       
       X - The major version number, 
           this only changes if the architecture has changed significant AND
           some or complete incompatibilities in the Java-API are drawn.
	   Synchronisation to other ports needed.
 
       Y - The minor version number,
           this may change if some changes or add-ons are made 
	   without incompatibility in the Java-API/ Java-Files.
	   Synchronisation to other ports is recommended.
 
       Z - The bugfix number,
           this may change for bugfix purposes in the
           Java- or Native-Files !
	   Synchronisation to other ports is not needed.
 
       R - The release number,
           for changes in native-libs, packaging, etc.
	   Synchronisation to other ports is not needed.
 
 The reason for synchronisation within X and Y is because 
 the GL4Java compatibility !

 A GL4Java X.Y.x.x application with an defined X and Y should run on all
 implementations !
 
 Another goal is that the gl4java.jar file of version X.Y.xx.xx can be used
 for any machine ! 
 
 My proposal is (from now on 2.0.0.1) to being synchronized for X and Y !
 Everybody has to make an GL4Java-RFC to all developers on GL4Java
 (actually three interests :-).

 Please add yourself to the GL4Java mailinglist !
