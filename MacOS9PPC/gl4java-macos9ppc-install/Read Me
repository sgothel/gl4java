GL4Java MAC Installation !If the AppleScript Installation failes,you can copy the files manually.The folder "sysextensions" represents thedestination folder <extensions folder> of your MACOS,which is usally located under MACOS:system:extensions !!Just copy the contents of "sysextensions"to the <extensions folder> recursively !Thats all !Prerequisites:	MRJ Java Runtime	OpenGLSources:	http://www.jausoft.com/gl4java/Notes:The stencil buffer and the accum buffer DOES work,but e.g. the hardware accelerated ATI OpenGL Rendererdoes NOT :-(But GL4Java does select the hardware renderer first, if avaiable !So, you have to disable the hardware renderer, if you want to usethose features (if the hardware renderer is "broken") !Use the "extension on/off" tool to achive this action !To check the installation, just start the GL4JavaInfo-Script !You should also download all the demos ...Yours, Sven Goethel
