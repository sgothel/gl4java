Since GL4Java 2.2.0, tesselation is supported !
================================================

Please look in the sources and/or javadoc
of: 
	gl4java.GLUTFunc

There exist also many demos:

	demos/MiscDemos/tess
	demos/MiscDemos/tessdemo
	demos/MiscDemos/tesswind

DETAILS
=======

The native callback manager of GL4Java seeks the 
callback function with:
	- callback method-type (the "which" argument of the Callback function)
	- the current gl-context

Because the callback manager functions do not know the 
tessellator/nurbs/quadratics id,
only ONE callback-method for one gl-context and "which"-method
is supported !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
