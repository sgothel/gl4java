Last Changes: 12th February  2001 (Version 2.5.2 - Release 0 )
Started:      July 1997 (Version 0)

-----------------
TOP  = NEW
DOWN = OLD
-----------------

12th February  2001 (Version 2.5.2 - Release 0 )
	o Implements JDK >= 1.3.X 's JAWT
	  The mechanism of fetching the native window handle (etc.),
	  is - since JDK 1.3.0 - now an official standard !
	  JAWT'S native lock's are also used.

	  This feature is used within the "GL4JavaJauGljJNI13"
	  native library, which is used dynamically if JVM >= 1.3 !
	  Many thanxs to Kenneth B. Russel for 
	  motivations: 
	  	JDK 1.4 will no more support the old 
	  	illegal style of fetching the native window handle !

	  The MacOs's implementation of JAWT is currently
	  missing ...

	o Improved the mutlithreading behavior !
	  Now - you MUST encapsulate all your rendering
	  within gljMakeCurrent/gljFree !
	  E.g. the implementation of GLCanvas's display method !

	  This style was recommended all the time !
	  
	o Prepared for 64bit platforms !
	  If you set the #define USE_64BIT_POINTER
	  within the symbols.mak, the "long" type is used for
	  Pointer conversion (cast) !

	  Depending on the #define USE_64BIT_POINTER,
	  the typedef PointerHolder is set.
	  PointerHolder is used for type casting, which
	  eliminates not just compiler warning, but also
	  bad generated assembler type conversion code !

	  All pointer holder's within the java classes are jlong !

	  From now on, you MUST use the java "long" type to
	  hold any pointers - also for the GLU stuff, e.g.

 	  WARNING - INCOMPATIBILITY
	  =========================
	  If you use any gluNew* function,
	  you MUST change the l-value type to "long" 
	  and recompile your java sources !
		

8th February  2001 (Version 2.5.1 - Release 0 )
	o Bugfixed the JNI Tool Module Functions,
	  which had a bug within the Callback Helper Functions
	  for the GLU Callback Code !
	  Now, all pointers are checked to non zero !
	  Zero Pointers are now handled nice !
	  Thanxs to Sahuc David, who found the case,
	  where GLU Combined Callback creates an zero pointer within the 
	  vertices array !

18th November  2000 (Version 2.5.0 - Release 0 )
	o Added this source tree to CVS at GL4Java.sourceforge.net !
	  (the binary only directories:
	  	archive
		binpkg
           are kept empty)

	o Moved "sun.awt.windows.*" -> "gl4java.jau.awt.windows.*"
	  One changes to access the new location is made in:
	  	gl4java.GLContext 

	o Changed the gl4java.awt.GLAnimCanvas error/warning
	  printout. Now, the "problem in use() method" 
	  is printed out only, if gl4java.GLContext.gljClassDebug
	  is set to true !
	  Also the above error text is splitted in two more
	  comprehensive error text.

	o The native method
		gl4java.GLContext.gljGetCurrentContext
	  is added for those, who things they need it ...

18th September 2000 (Version 2.4.1 - Release 2 )

	o Added Apple MAC OS9.0 PPC support !!
	  This is based upone Gerard Ziemski's
	  sources.

	  - Included a special Mac distribution:
	  	- Installer Disk-Image with AppleScript Installation !
	  	- Demo Disk-Image !

	o Fixed & Added Demos:
		- added Hodglim's NeHe port
		- all demos are now in doubleBuffer mode !
		- all demos does requestFocus right,
		  for key-input !

18th August 2000 (Version 2.4.1 - Release 0 )

	o Improved the Installer code to Version 2.04 !
	  Please read about this in Installer/CHANGES.txt !

	  	Mostly the standalone installation process is improved !

	o Removed the special MAC library names,
	  now the MAC should use the default ...

	o Added 2 new native libraries for testing purpose:
		[lib]GL4JavaJauGLJNItst[.so | .dll]
		[lib]GL4JavaJauGLUJNItst[.so | .dll]
	  
	  These libs does check, if given arrays arguments
	  are handled with the JNI_COPY method or not.

	  If they are handled with the JNI_COPY method,
	  a warning is printed !

	o Added a new native library set:
		[lib]GL4JavaJauGljJNI12[.so | .dll]
		[lib]GL4JavaJauGLJNI12[.so | .dll]
		[lib]GL4JavaJauGLJNI12tst[.so | .dll]
		[lib]GL4JavaJauGLUJNI12[.so | .dll]
		[lib]GL4JavaJauGLUJNI12tst[.so | .dll]
	  This new JNI12 set, respects the new JNI features 			
			- GetPrimitiveArrayCritical
			- ReleasePrimitiveArrayCritical
	  this new libraries are automatically loaded,
	  if the JVM is >= 1.2 !
	  So array copies should be avoided, 
	  especially in JVM >= 1.3 (+ hotspot) !!

	  This task is done with the new C2J, and with a
	  new jni12tools.c module.

	  Check out the gl4java.util.Test section below !

	o Added a performance test shell in demos/MiscDemos:

		PerformanceCheck.sh

	  where allready existing test exist under:
	  	./PerformanceLogs/

	  This script uses the native and the java gears demo.
	  (In the future, may be we add more native/java comparable demos)

	  The java demos is tested with all installed JVM's,
	  which environment setup scripts are located under
	  	./PerformanceEtc/profile.jdk* !

	o Added gl4java.util.Test !
	  This class's purpose is to just start derivations of
	  	gl4java.awt.GLCanvas
	  	gl4java.awt.GLAnimCanvas
	  	gl4java.applet.SimpleGLAnimApplet1

	  So there is no need for the old
	  and dirty inner class game, just for testing ...
	  Just to make those demos (GL*Canvas) public ...

	  I have added two little SHELL scripts
	  	demos/test.sh
	  	demos/test-jnitst.sh
	  	demos/test-jni12tst.sh
	  which starts the (1st argument) java testclass with
	  	- default libs -, or
	  	*JNItst*, or
		*JNI12tst* libraries !
	  The purpose for the two last ones
	  is to force the usage of the special JNI libs.
	  The JNI and JNI12 functions can be tested this way,
	  if some array is copied !

	o Using the JAVA_HOME environment variable
	  within the symbols.mak files ...

	o Added new arguments for gl4java.GLContext.main(..) !
	  Now, it is more usable ... more verbose

	o Added a better error tolerant X11 Visual fetching mechanims.
	  All glXGetConfig's are now tested for all avaiable visuals,
	  if no visual is offered ...

	o Respecting the accumulator bits size with/in:
		gl4java.GLContext.accumSize (new constructor also)
		gl4java.awt.GLCanvas.accumSize (for usage in e.g. preInit)

	o Removing the whole non-dynamic code part,
	  to make things clear !
	  The "#define _GL_DYNAMIC_BINDING_" is no more needed !

 	o Removing the compilation depending define
	  _HAS_GLXGETPROCADDRESSARB_ !
	  The existence of glXGetProcAddressARB, glXGetProcAddressEXT or
	  glXGetProcAddress is queried during runtime within
	  	- libGL.so and libglx.so (only the first time with dlsym) !

	o Optimized the Array handling in the JNI part !
	  IF (the array parameter is const) OR 
	     (copy is not used within the JVM)
	  THEN
	  	Release<type>ArrayElements(X,X,X,JNI_ABORT/*just release*/)
	  ELSE
	  	Release<type>ArrayElements(X,X,X,0 /*copy back*/)
	  FIN

	  Also, the redundant Set<type>ArrayRegion call is removed !

	o Optimizing the gl4java/utils/glut/GLUTFuncLightImpl teapot
	  implementation !

26. June 2000 (Version 2.4.0 - Release 0 )

    -- Major Changes

	o All changes makes it possible to have only one 
	  native library for one platform !

	o Changing dynamically to the mode: create an own overlapped window,
	  if the native java window does not support the needed properties,
	  e.g. double buffering !

	o Added "repaint" calls in GLCanvas,
	  if: 
	      - A GL Context is made and initialized AND
	  	- GLCanvas is resized
		- the mouse is clicked on GLCanvas
	        - the top level window is moved
	        - the top level window is activated
	  This must be done, because of missing natural repaint events
	  for Unices with own created windows !

	o (X11) Added usage of the accumulation buffer,
	  the previous version missed to set the values for the
	  visual attribute list !

	o Added usage of:
	     X11: glXGetProcAddressARB(<GL-Func-Name>) 
	          and dlsym(<GL-Func-Name>)

	     Win32: wglGetProcAddress(<GL-Func-Name>)
	            and getProcAddress(<GL-Func-Name>)

	     Mac: aglGetProcAddress(<GL-Func-Name>) ?

	  in all generated OpenGL function calls.
	  This is achieved by the new C2J compiler.
	  No statical linkage is needed anymore for the OpenGL
	  functions, so no dummy functions must be generated for
	  some missing OpenGL 1.2 functions of a implementation.
	  	If glXGetProcAddressARB is not supported by your X11/GL libs,
	  you can not use the define _HAS_GLXGETPROCADDRESSARB_
	  in symbols.mak - then, only the dlsym mechanism will be used !

	  GLContext.gljTestGLProc (<GL-Func-Name>) is added,
	  which uses the *GetProcAddress* methods, described above.

          GLContext.gljGetVersions() adds a string with one line 
	  for all known OpenGL functions with the information if it does
	  exist in the underlying GL implementation.

	  This new feature is only used, if
	  	#define _GL_DYNAMIC_BINDING_
	  is set e.g. in symbols.mak !
	  Then you have to use/link the special generated files by C2J:
	  	OpenGL_JauJNI*_dynfuncs.c
	  instead of OpenGL_JauJNI*_funcs.c for static binding.

	o Added support for Offscreen-Rendering and Swing:
		gl4java.GLContext.createOffScreenCtx(...)
		gl4java.swing.*
	  Please check the demos in: demos/GLSwingDemos !
	  You can also read the SwingUsage.txt file !
	  (Thanxs to www.desys.com !)

	o Using Mesa 3.3 beta headers for the GL & GLU function
	  creation (C2J) !

    -- Minor Changes

	o Added "GLContext.gljMakeCurrent()", and put the old one
	  "gljMakeCurrent(boolean)" to deprecated !
	  It makes no sense to explicit release the GL context,
	  because on all OS it does release the GL context automatically,
	  if a new one is attached !

	o Steven Hugg added more Png texture features:
		- grayscale, gray-alpha, rgb, rgb-alpha
		

01. April 2000 (Version 2.3.1 - Release 1 )

	o Changed the Installer code to Version 2.02 !
	  Please read about this in Installer/CHANGES.txt !

	  Now a new binary installer package is provided,
	  to be able to download the installer and run it 
	  as an application !
	  
	o Bugfixes for some java jdk117 incompatibilities !
	  (Thanxs to gerard ziemski for finding this out !)
	  I have used some Java2 features :-(,
	  but - Gerard stated this true - we need jdk117 compatibility !

	  The following code is changed:
	  	gl4java.utils.textures.AWTTextureLoader:
		  No packages:
		     import java.awt.Color.*;
		     import java.awt.color.*;
		  No java.awt.image.BufferedImage,
		  so we just guess, it is 24bit RGB data !

		gl4java.awt.GLImageCanvas:
		  No java.awt.Component.getWidth/Height methods !
		  Using cvsGet* method !

	        A FEW DEMOs: demos/RonCemers/*.java,
		where the KeyEvent.VK_KP_* is used (deleted) !

	o For the binary port to the SGI-IRIX-65-MIPS
	  machine, the following files were added:
	  	- symbols.mak.sgi-irix65-mips
		- mklibs/mkslib.irix6.2
		- CNativeCode/gl.sgi-irix65.not.c
		- CNativeCode/gl.sgi-irix65.not.h

30. March 2000 (Version 2.3.1 - Release 0 )

	o Reversed the time order of this FILE :-) !
	  PLEASE read this File - before you ask !
	  Please check the JavaDOC API and the DEMOS
	  also - befor you ask !
	  THANXS !

	o All changes in this revision only affect the JAVA-CLASSES,
	  regarding:
	      - gl4java.utils.textures.*
		  - Complete rework (class hierarchie, IS compatible) !
		  - Allows URL/uri arguments to load textures !
		  - New TextureLoader implementations:
		  	- AWTTextureLoader
			- TGATextureLoader
		  - TextureTool with new functionality (scale/texImage2D*)

		  - Please have a lock at gl4java.awt.GLImageCanvas
		    and in the demos:
		    	- demos/MiscDemos/GLImageViewerCanvas.java
		    	- demos/MiscDemos/GLImageViewerWorld.java
				- check out my transparent jaulogo,
				  loaded with the png-loader !

	      - gl4java.utils.*
	      	  - New Class Tool.java to achieve some informations !
		    General purpose, static methods should be placed
		    here ...

	      - gl4java.awt.*
	      	  - New Class GLImageCanvas.java, which uses
		    a lot of the new functionality of the 
		    package gl4java.utils.textures !
		    Please have a lock in the demo:
		    	demos/MiscDemos/GLImageViewerCanvas.java
		    where you have a little image-loader/saver
		    based on OpenGL :-)) !


28. March 2000 (Version 2.3.0 - Release 0 )

	o Added Shared GL-Context feature !
	  Just look into the demos/MiscDemos/SharedGLContext* Files !
	  Your shared GLContext should be set in GL[Anim]Canvas,
	  like the stencilBits, etc. Use the attribute "sharedGLContext" !
	  OS Impl.: Please add the feature in the native get_GC method !
	  (Thanxs to "Artiste on the Web" for initiating and for the
	   first X11 implementation.)

	o Modified the TextureLoader Class, to support:
		- Files and InputStreams !
          This works like the TextureGrabber base class,
	  so the all input media is broken down to an InputStream !

	o Added a Graphics.setClip(..) call to the GLCanvas paint method !
	  This is needed for e.g. Macintosh machine !
	  (Thanxs to Martin Orton !)

	o Added/Modified demos:
		demos/RonsDemos/FullScreenGears (application, new)
		  (Thanxs to Virgil Wall !)
		demos/MiscDemos/SharedGLContext* (see above, new)

	  Some Demo's under:
		demos/MiscDemos/
		demos/GLLandScape/
	  uses the new main method, which supports win32jvm !
	  (Thanxs to Virgil Wall !)

14. March 2000 (Version 2.2.0 - Release 1 )

	o BugFix of the Win32 JNI JVM native library:
		- Java_gl4java_GLContext_gljResizeNative
		With correct arguments now.
	o Distinguish the Win32 x86 native package
	between MSJVM and StdJVM -> lesser download size !

6. March 2000 (Version 2.2.0 - Release 0 )

	o The pointer conversion to the "long" type did not worked for
	  Netscape under linux !
	  A "bus error" occures, while using "long" in the native part !
	  So all pointer presentations are kept "int" !!

	o All GLU Callback Functions (Tessellators, ...)
	  are now supported while using the JNI reflections
	  and seeking the fitting method for method-type 
	  and gl-context !
	  Please have a look in Tesselation.txt !

	o Added GLUT Font support !
	  Thanxs to Pontus Lidman (Mathcore) for supporting
	  GL4Java with GLUT font support !
	  The special package: 
		gl4java.utils.glut.fonts
	  provides the new GLUT class:
	        GLUTFuncLightImplWithFonts
	  which is derived from the GLUT class:
		gl4java.utils.glut.GLUTFuncLightImpl
	  This new package provides font support 
	  and contains the font data and the font-class 
	  code generation code.

	  This new package gl4java.utils.glut.fonts
	  is distributet in an own jar/zip file:
		  gl4java2.2.0.0-glutfonts-classes.zip
		  gl4java2.2.0.0-glutfonts-jar.zip
	  This is done, because of its size - about 200kBytes !
	  But this optional package is selected
	  within the Installer as the default ;-) !

	  Look at demos/MiscDemos/glutFont*Test.html
	  for the new font demos !

	o Added texture grabber class:
		gl4java.utils.textures.TGATextureGrabber implements
		gl4java.utils.textures.TextureGrabber
	  this default impl. uses the TGA file type,
	  to save the opengl framebuffer !
          Thanxs to Erwin 'KLR8' Vervaet for the TGA writer code !
	  The demos: tessdemo, tesswind and morph3d 
	  include a snapshot menue, if started as an application !

	o In class gl4java.awt.GLCanvas, 
	  the following attributes are made public:
	    public GLFunc gl = null;
	    public GLUFunc glu = null;

	  The following attribute stays protected and can be fetched
	  by the method: "public final GLContext getGLContext()"
	    protected GLContext glj = null;

	o The stencilBits configuration for stencil-bit number setup
	  for X11 and Win32 system is implemented !

	  The OpenGL Stencil feature works now !

	  The usage of the stencil buffer does work now !
	  	Look at demos/MiscDemos/stencil.html
	  for the new stencil demo !

	  Changes in:
	  	Native: X11, Win32, Win32JDirect
			TODO: Macintosh

		Java: gl4java.GLContext, gl4java.awt.GLCanvas

	o The new Flag GLContext::createOwnWindow 
	  (mapped in GLCanvas, like doubleBuffer, stencilBits, ...)
	  controlls the behavior of the native window code.
	  If createOwnWindow equals true, 
	  an new overlayed window is created.
	  This is sometimes needed for some machines, 
	  like SGI's Irix or maybe IBM's AIX !
	  This flag can be forced to be always true,
	  by setting the compile definition:
	    #define GL4JAVA_FORCE_X11_OWN_WINDOW
	    ( gcc -D GL4JAVA_FORCE_X11_OWN_WINDOW ... )
	  This should be always set for IRIX !
	  At this time some refresh problems occure,
	  if the window comes on top again.

	  Changes in:
	  	Native: X11

		Java: gl4java.GLContext, gl4java.awt.GLCanvas

	o C2J bugfix 1.2
	  - GLUtesselator is now supported !
	  - All GLU methods are now implemented !
	  - Added support for NULL/null pointer arrays,
	    so you can call e.g. 
	    	"glu.gluTessBeginPolygon(tobj, (double[])null);"
	    The C-JNI part does handle it now !

24. January 2000 (Version 2.1.3 - Release 2 )

	o This version is based upon Mesa 3.1,
	  the older versions are based upon Mesa 3.0
	  (For GL and GLU function creation (C2J), etc.)
	  So we do support:
	  	OpenGL 1.2
		GLU    1.2
	  But be sure, that your underlying OpenGL native library
	  does support OpenGL 1.2 and GLU 1.2 also !!!

	o Now supports - in respect to Mesa 3.1:
		- GL_EXT_stencil_wrap
		- GL_NV_texgen_reflection
		- GL_PGI_misc_hints
		- GL_EXT_compiled_vertex_array
		- GL_EXT_clip_volume_hint

	  - The following extensions are skipped from Mesa 3.1:
		- GL_INGR_blend_func_separate
		- GL_ARB_multitexture

	o C2J has changed to respect the new Mesa Version 3.1
	  All "void *" Arguments of one function are mapped to all java
	  array-types. 

14. Dezember 1999 (Version 2.1.3 - Release 1)

	For MesaNvidia 3.1 (Linux-x86) ONLY !

	o Changed the version for Mesa-NVidia to MesaNvidia 3.1 (Linux-x86)
		- This is done in the Installer,
		- and the CNative/gl.nvidia.not.c file !

	o Added installation instructions for the png.jar archive !			
07. Dezember 1999 (Version 2.1.3 - Release 0 )

	o Added Ron Cemer's Installer to this repository.
          This is a changed version - version 2.00,
	  which based upon Ron's orig. version 1.05 !
	  Please read the Installer/CHANGES.txt !

	o Added geometric GLUT support: gl4java.utils.glut !
	  See some demos in demos/MiscDemos !
	  This is a lightweight implementation,
	  meaning that the SGI sources are used !

	o Added more Demos, e.g. morph3d !

	o Added PNG-TextureLoader support in gl4java.utils.textures !
	  This packages uses the LGPL png classes:
		  Copyright (c) 1998,1999  Six-Legged Software
          Please read the PNG-*.txt files !

	  The 1st code, which usese the PNG class,
	  and the original scale-code is written by:
	  Max Rheiner  <mrn@paus.ch> !

	  Check the demo: demos/MiscDemos/pngTextureTestApplet.java !

18. November 1999 (Version 2.1.2 - Release 2 )

	o Some errors moved into the DEMOS section !
	  - GL_TRUE and GL_FALSE are now set to the new boolean ...

        o Ron Cemer's Demos are adapted and modified
	  to achieve more compatibility. See demos/RonsDemos/index.html !

	o A new Class "gl4java/applet/SimpleGLAnimApplet1.java"
	  is made and used by all animation classes of Ron Cemer !
	  This package (gl4java/applet) is now part of the 
	  distribution !

	  Please update at least the java archive/classes 
	  (especially the Windows-Users, where the native libs
	   has no changes ! )

	o ReWork of the X11-Window-System part,
	  which achieve the XVisual.
	  This is another try, because the Irix-Systems
	  have some troubles .... :-(

14. November 1999 (Version 2.1.2 - Release 1 )

	o ReFactoring of the C2J Parser,
	  which generates all the Java/C native glue !
	  	
		- Complete re-work to select all information
		  into objects while parsing,
		  instead of just printing them out !

		- Printing the objects (functions-declarations)
		  in different formats:
		  	- JNI-Java Code
			- JNI-C Code
			- MSJDirect Code

		- Handels "void *" in the argument-list in the way,
		  that each functions will be generate SEVEN times
		  with the following type-substitutions:
		  	"byte[]", "short[]", "int[]",
			"float[]", "double[]", "boolean[]", "long[]"
		  Only 1 "void *" in the arg-lidt can be handled now.
		  This is enough for OpenGL ;-)

		  The function overloading is done 
		  with the Java function signature,
		  so a ANSI-C compiler is enough !

		- Handels double Pointers -> [][] - and more ;-) !

		- Handels "const" arguments correct:
			- no more SetArray calls

		- Gives semantic error messages,
		  if something can not be handled !
		  E.g.: More than 1 "void *" argument,
		  or a pointer-type as the function-type !

	o Because of the essential changes of C2J
	  The following benefits for GL4Java exist:

		- Only the glGetString, gluGetString gluErrorString
		  functions must be written manualy now !!!!

		- Better compatibility with "GLvoid *" arguments.
		  This means - not just "byte[]" can be used -
		  	"byte[]", "short[]", "int[]",
			"float[]", "double[]", "boolean[]", "long[]"
		  functions are generated !

		- Better MS-JDirect (MS-JVM) integeration !

	o Complete OpenGL 1.2 support (if native OpenGL supports it) !
	  So missing functions like:
		void glEnableClientState( GLenum cap );
		void glDisableClientState( GLenum cap );
	  do exist now.
	  This is because of the new C2J !

	o Nearly Complete GLU 1.1 support - Except :
		- gluScaleImage (Only byte[] i/o is supported)

		- The following are not supported,
		  because they do use function-pointers:
			- gluQuadricCallback
			- gluNurbsCallback
			- gluTessCallback
	  This is because of the new C2J !

	o Changed all "native pointer" presentation in Java 
	  from "int" to "long" !
	  I guess this provides a better compatibility to 
	  64 bit machines with 64 bits per adress !

	o Win32: Added ALL EXT functions which exists in MSVC 6.0 header files
	  to the gl4java_bin_ext function in gl.win32.ext.c !
	  
14. Oktober 1999 (Version 2.1.1 - Release 0 )

	o Added to the demo-package:
		- Ron's demos 
		- RectRenderSpeed

30. AUGUST 1999 (Version 2.1.0 - Release 1 )

	o Added symbols.mak and gl.not.c for NVIDIA Mesa GLX Module

	o X11: Fixed XVisualInfo query, while just setting a prefix now, 
	  instead of using the found XVisualInfo (RGBA, DOUBLEBUFFER) !
	  This fixes the double buffering problem with 
	  some hardware accelerated OpenGL driver !

	o Merged MSJVM port
		- Ron Cemers port to the MS-JVM is merged.
		  The following MS-JVM (build 3186) is needed:
			  "Microsoft (R) VM for Java, 5.0 Release 5.0.0.3186"
		  New classes for MS-JVM:
			. gl4java.system.GljMSJDirect
			. gl4java.GLFuncMSJDirect
			. gl4java.GLUFuncMSJDirect
			. sun.awt.windows.MSWin32HandleAccess
		  New native library for MS-JVM:
		  	. GL4JavaGljMSJDirect
		  New documentation for MS-JVM:
		  	. MS-JVM.txt
			. README.RonCemer (updated original)
		  	
		- The MS-Java-SDK >= 2.0 is needed 
 		  (A SUN std. JDK is still needed)
		- To give the port a better distinguish,
		  I droped the JDirect stuff outta gl4java.GLContext
		  to gl4java.system.GljMSJDirect
		- gl4java.system.GljMSJDirect,
		  gl4java.GLFuncMSJDirect,
		  gl4java.GLUFuncMSJDirect and
		  sun.awt.windows.MSWin32HandleAccess is compiled ONLY
		  with the MS-Java-Compiler ;-) !
		- gl4java.system.GljMSJDirect,
		  gl4java.GLFuncMSJDirect,
		  gl4java.GLUFuncMSJDirect do have the MS-Java state:
		  "@security(checkDllCalls=off)", so if you have
		  the classes and dll installed, you can run
		  the applet within the MS-IE 4.0 :-) without cab's !
		- The old glj* native methods and the new glj*JDirect
		  native methods are improved:
			- function arguments, instead of object retrieving
			  (for the old ones, like Ron's -> faster)
			- straight usage of "static" "final", if usabel !
		- The method "doCleanup" and the paranoia implementation
		  of "cvsDispose" is taken over from Ron 
		  within gl4java.awt.GLCanvas
		- glj.gljResize() is now called within the paint method,
		  instead of the reshape method, which is for 
		  users-overwrite purpose - so you cannot forget it.
		  This is important - especially for the MS-JVM, to
		  resize the own created native window !
		  
	o Prepared for merging Macintosh port
		- I hope gl4java.GLContext and the other std. java-classes
		  must not be changed ...

	o Switched to MS-Visual-C++ 6.0 (Borland deleted)

	o Moved glDemosCvs to an Applet ;-)
	  Hmm - MS-IE is faster than Netscape (under Win32) with GL4Java ... 

	o Added visual properties in gl4java.GLContext:
		- doubleBuffer
		- stereoView
	  These can be set with the constructor now
	  and are updated after creating the OpenGL-Context,
	  while quering with glXGetConfig/getPixelFormat../... !
	  If one of these properties is invalid for the hardware,
	  the native stuff in GL4Java has to "fall back" and set the
	  java flags correct !
	  These states can be queried with gl4java.GLContext !

	o Added gljSetEnabled()/gljIsEnabled() to gl4java.GLContext !

	o Added doubleBuffer, stereoView to
	  gl4java.awt.GLCanvas as transparent params (visual-properties)
	  to use for the gl4java.GLContext constructor !

	o Added preInit() to gl4java.awt.GLCanvas to give the user a chance
	  to modify the default visual-properties !

	o Now using Ron's "capsapi_classes.zip" within compilation
	  of GL4Java, to prevent the users to add some
	  netscape or other java-api's to his classpath !
	  Look at symbols.mak !

11. JUNE 1999 (Version 2.0.2 - Release 1)

	o Fixed gl4java.awt.GLAnimCanvas !

	  - Now the fps rate is adapted for every frame - all the time.
	    No more stocking animations !!!

	  - Set the default fps value to 20 :-) !

	o The X11 native function gljSwap()
	  does not call glXWaitX and glXWaitGL anymore (-> faster ?!) !
	  I hope this is not needed - please tell if so !

	o The gl.solaris.not.c file is repaired !

        o Now the makefile uses the zip-utility again.
	  I registered, that the java-jar zip-files
	  could not be read by WinZip :-( !

	o all zip archives should be readable for win32/tools.

01. JUNE 1999 (Version 2.0.1 - Release 2)

	o Added files:
		- VERSIONS.txt (describes the version numbers)
		- THANXS.txt   (for all the helping hands ...)

 	o The gl4java.jar package of the previous version included
	  encryption information which where wrong.
	  This bug diabled Netscape from using the JAR archive :( !
	  This is now fixed :) !

	o Tested GL4Java with jdk1.2-pre-v1 on Linux, it works !
	  You must disable JIT and enable NATIVE THREADS !

	o Removed native-libs other than 
		- libGL4Java-Linux-glibc-2.X-mesa3.0pthreads-x86
		- libGL4Java-Win32-x86

        o Now having UNIXTYPE/WIN32TYPE defined 
          instead of UNIXLIBDIR/WIN32LIBDIR in symbols.mak,
          where only the OS is specified - not the GL4Java version !
          Now - a tar-gz/zip file is generated for the specific 
          OS-type - not a directory. The filename contains the
          GL4Java name+version and the OS type information !
	  This is also done for the gl4java.jar file !

	o No more GL4Java*bin archive exists !
	  Now all needed files for a binary-installation
	  (the native-libs and gl4java.jar) moved to the 'binpkg' directory !
	  Have a more closer look at INSTALL.txt !

18. MAY 1999 (Version 2.0.1 - Release 1)

	o Netscape 4.5 (Win32) PrivilegeManager usage was incorrect
	  (used 30caps...), now using "UniversalLinkAccess" !

	  This now works for me within Win95 and WinNT !

	o Made some bugfixes within the source code include-file-names
	  and the gl.solaris.not.* files and the makefile
	  (thanxs Odell Reynolds)

	o added support for the Win32 OpenGL-EXT functions,
	  wich are now loaded via 'wglGetProcAddress' the very first time !

	o added 'glColorTableEXT' support within GLFunc and its implementations.

20. APRIL 1999 (Version 2.0.0 - Release 1)

	o This new Major Release announces a new implementation !

  	  GL4Java V 2.X.X.X uses a new object model, which allows
  	  separation of GLEnum, GLUEnum, GLFunc*, GLUFunc* and GLContext !

	  GLFunc*
	  	implements GLEnum
  
	  GLUFunc*
	  	implements GLUEnum

	  GLContext
	  	has_a	   GLFunc*
	  	has_a	   GLUFunc*
  
  	  For compatibility issues, 
  	  i do provide the class gl4java.awt.GLCanvas,
  	  which:
	  	implements 	GLEnum
	  	implements 	GLUEnum
  		has_a		GLFuncJauJNI
  		has_a		GLUFuncJauJNI
  		has_a	 	GLContex
  		is_a		Canvas
  
  	  The little changes the user must do in his sources are:
  		change: GL4Java.GLCanvas   -> gl4java.awt.GLCanvas
  		change: gljGetFpsCounter   -> cvsGetFpsCounter
  		change: gljResetFpsCounter -> cvsResetFpsCounter
  		change: gljGetWidth        -> cvsGetWidth
  		change: gljGetHeight       -> cvsGetHeight
  		change: gljDispose         -> cvsDispose  
  		change: gljUse() 	   -> glj.gljMakeCurrent(true)
  		change: glj* 		   -> glj.glj*
  		change: gl* 		   -> gl.gl*
  		change: glu* 		   -> glu.glu*
		change: GLCanvas.glClassDebug  -> GLContext.gljClassDebug
		change: GLCanvas.glNativeDebug -> GLContext.gljNativeDebug
		change: glClassDebug           -> GLContext.gljClassDebug
		change: glNativeDebug          -> GLContext.gljNativeDebug

  
  		The little shell script change2GL4JavaV2.sh
  		will do this for you while using sed !

		The function 'GLContext.loadNativeLibraries(null,null,null)'
		is called in the static part of GLCanvasV2 !
		If you do not use GLCanvasV2, call it by yourself !

		If the given paramter 'libName's' is zero
		by calling GLContext.loadNativeLibraries,
		the default library-names are used - see below !
  
  	  Look in the new documentation and the demos,
  	  which explain the new model !
  
  	  So far ...

	o Added the sun.awt.macintosh.MacHandleAccess.java class,
	  and the appropriate Code to GLContext for
	  fetching the WinHandle and the library !
	  This is done to support Gerard Ziemski's Macinstosh-Port !

	  The default native library for Win32 and Unice's is :
	  	GLContext:	GL4JavaJauGljJNI
		GLFuncJauJNI:	GL4JavaJauGLJNI
		GLUFuncJauJNI:	GL4JavaJauGLUJNI
		
	  The default native library for Macintosh is :
	  	GLContext:	GL4JavaMacGZGljJNI
		GLFuncJauJNI:	GL4JavaMacGZGLJNI
		GLUFuncJauJNI:	GL4JavaMacGZGLUJNI

	   These lib-names are used, 
	   if 'GLContext.loadNativeLibraries( String gljLibName,
	   i				      String glLibName, 
	   				      String gluLibName )'
	   is called with an null argument !

	o updated documentation
	  now using java2's javadoc ;-)

	o now, only a MS OpenGL binding is supported,
 	  because SGI does not support their library anymore :-( !

19. APRIL 1999 (Version 1.2.0 R2)

	o Netscape 4.5 (Win32) PrivilegeManager usage only if we are
	  running the Netscape JVM !

	o Java-PlugIn for Browser works.
	  Added Java2 Plugin HTML-Pages in demos (demos/*J2P.html) !
	  Tested with Win32,Netscape,Java2 !
	  See INSTALL.txt for docu.

	o Added static main function in GLCanvas and GLFrame,
	  to just checking the library loading !

	o supporting explicit library loading with static function
	  loadNativeLibrary in GLCanvas and GLFrame

	o debugged gljDispose: using topLevelWindow only if != null :-)

18. APRIL 1999 (Version 1.2.0 R1)

	o Added Netscape 4.5 (Win32) support !
	  Because Netscape JVM supports JNI, we do try
	  to ask for a privilege :-) to run native DLL's !

	  Please read the chapter <Source Installation>,
	  <Binary Installation> in the given documentation, or the 
	  INSTALL.txt file for changes !

	  This task is done for Eloi Maduell
	  who asked for it :-) - thanxs !

	o Docs supports now JAVA2

	o boolean gljIsInit();
	  is added - to query if the users init function is allready done !
	  Now - we can call start and stop while doing animations
	  directly from the applets class.
	  Look in the demo directory at:

	  	glOlympicCvsApplet and glLogoCvsApplet

	  Also gljIsInit is used to query we are able to render,
	  better than just check if we just got the gl-context !

	o Updated dummyGL.java and dummyGLCvs.java, also
	  olympicCvs.java and glLogoCvs.java and
	  glOlympicCvsApplet, glLogoCvsApplet !
	  
	  The above files are now JAVA2 and applet clean !

	o Added Java2Applet.bat and Java2AppletB.bat with gl4java.policy
	  to use JAVA2 appletviewer ! 
	  (you have to change the gl4java.policy file) !

	o make creates now a GL4Java.jar file - also :-)

	o added Elois Maduell Texture Test JApplet which uses PPM.
	  Moddified his one to use JAVA2 Swing, and Netscape !

25. JAN 1999 (Version 1.1.0 - Release 3 )

	o added glXWaitX after glXWaitGL in OpenGL_X11.c.skel

	o tested with MetroX Metro-Extreme-3D (OpenGL - Hardwareaccelerated)
	  this works, but there is flickering while animation,
	  and i do not know why - checked it with native/x11/glX* 
	  dem testGL2 where no flickering is :-(
	  Also Metro3D does not have any GL-EXT funcs ...

	o merged Leung Yau Wai´s Win32 patch.
	  he checked minimized the "not implemented Win32" functions :-)
	  Thanxs Leung !
	  The problem was to use BC5 OpenGL include files,
	  which are not complete ;-(
	  So i put the SGI-OpenGL-Include-Path to the first place :-)))

15. JAN 1999 (Version 1.1.0 - Release 2 )

	o added a SunOS 5.X patch for Sun´s OpenGL library
	  included a new define _GL_SOLARIS_ with it´s
	  c-stubs in CNativeCode directory
	
	o Linux: changed to glibc and Mesa3.0 with pthreads

	o added precompiled SunOS lib linked against mesa

	o the demos/native/x11 are now compiler-clean
	  please check the makefile

	o changed the license to lgpl, see LICENSE.TXT

	o documentation changes:
		- german OpenGL intro is not more included in the html-version
		- now using LaTeX2Html Version 98.2 beta8


06. JULI 1998 (Version 1.1.0)

        o Creating new GL4Java top class GLCanvas,
          which support and is derived from Canvas.
          Now it is possible, to use a canvas to render OpenGL :-)
          New Files:
                o GL4Java/GLCanvas.java
                o LIBRARIES: GL4JavaCanvas AND GL4JavaCanvas32
        
        o debugging of some JNI functions - thanxs to Java 1.2 beta 3,
          which shows me the errors :-)

        o Using a new way to achieve the native Window-Handle.
          Fetched the methods from the Canvas3d Class outta Java3d-Package :-)
          Now GL4Java runs with Java 1.1.6 and higher (also Java 1.2 beta 3)
           - changed sun.awt.motif.*DataAccess -> sun.awt.motif.X11HandleAccess
           - changed sun.awt.windows.*DataAccess -> sun.awt.motif.Win32HandleAccess
           - changed GL4Java.*DataAccess -> sun.awt.motif.WinHandleAccess

        o Some rework for makefiles :-)

        o LaTeX Documentation-Update :-)
           - Now we do support a postscript version !   

        o GLCanvas examples (check glDemosCvs)

        o The precompiled Win32 versions are made with:
                - BC5, Intel-Compiler, Optimisations, Pentium-Optimisations !
        
        o added a MSVC 5.0 Project directory WIN32VC.
          i used this one to perfom debugging :-)

24. JUNI 1998 (Version 1.0.2)

        o using tar archives in binpkg for the unix-libs ..
          no symbolic-links are needed anymore, so we can put this
          project on a vfat filesystem for convinient crossdevelopment

        o changed all demos.
          now, the demos (included the dummyGL.java)
          using a frame-per-secound method with repaint and sleep
          to create animation !

        o if the native library GL4Java is not found,
          GL4Java32 will be loaded.
          GL4Java32 is only for Windows32 users,
          and uses only MS native libs: opengl32.dll and glu32.dll
          (see chapter ´Binary Installation´ in the documentation) !!!

        o improvements in the makefile,
          better distinguish of win32 and unix users !
          Now win32-users can REALY use the makefile :-)

        o LaTeX-documentation update, with a better
          installation description for unix & win32

        - This work is done to prepare for rework GL4Java.
          GL4Java should support canvas :-)

23. Feb 1998 (Still Version 1.0.1)

        o fixing the documentation (LaTeX stuff)

        o using JavaCC Version 0.7.1, modified C2J for this purpose

03. Nov 1997 (Version 1.0.1)

        o fixed mkslib.<OS> scripts for all OS !

        o tested AIX V 4.2 port - it works - but should work better :-))

21. Okt 1997 (Version 1.0.0)
        
        o X11 (SunOS 5.X - Solaris) works with green threads

        o Found out that if we use Mesa, we need to use Version 2.4 or higher

        o Added the BUGFIX Version Number !


19. Okt 1997 (Version 1.0)

          o 'sDisplay' changes.
          'sDisplay' now has NO more semaphore's.
          'sDisplay' actually uses 'gljFree' (see above) to avoid 
          GL Context problems.
          'sDisplay' sets the actual Thread to highes priority before
          calling 'display' AND resets its priority after 'display'.
          We now do not have to care about another reentranced thread.
          We beleave (;-) 'gljFree' and 'priority settings' are enough.
          'sDisplay' is still a 'synchronized' method !

        o Multi Threading  works

        o X11 (Linux) works

        o X11 (Solaris, Aix) still have to be checked !
          (but we guessing that they will work ;-)

        o Windows 32 (Windows NT, Windows 95) works 
          (We use SGI DLL's !)
        

15. OKT 1997 (Version 1.0 beta5 )
        
        o Added ´void reshape (int,int)´ for the resize.
          This is not like the deprecated 1.0 API,
          but like glut´s reshape callback function !
          ´reshape´ will be invoked, when sDisplay 
          check the flag ´mustResize´ and it´s true.
          ´mustResize´ is set by ´componentResize´ !
          ´GLFrame.reshape´ implements the default GL behavior,
          but if you want to - you can overload it now ;-)))

        o Added ´GLFrame´ as a windowListener 
          to act for ´windowClosing´ !

          ´windowClosing´ calls ´gljDestroy´ (see lower) AND ´dispose´ !

        o Added ´gljFree´, ´gljDestroy´ .
          ´gljFree´ releases the GL Context AND
          ´gljDestroy´ destroys it !

          ´gljFree´ is always invoked after ´sDisplay´ called ´display´ !
          This is needed while having some GL Context problems in
          glXMakeCurrent (or wglMakeCurrent ;-) for some plattforms. 
          The Java Event Thread wants to set gc as current, but its allready
          has a gc set current. So we just release (NOT destroy) the GC !

          ´gljDestroy´ is invoked by ´windowClosing´ ;-)))

        o ´setVisible´ MUST be invoked by the subclass´s constructor 
          after calling the super-class constructor at the end.
          We have saw that the class global arrays with agregat-initializing
          were not initialized yet :-( !

        o updated all demos AND added ´glLogo´ and ´glDemos´.

          ´glDemos´ manages invocation of all demos ;-))
          Incl. multi-threading :-)))


10. OKT 1997 (Version 1.0 beta2 )

        o Solaris SunOs 5.5 is created and all the following 
          changes  and bugfixes were found while porting to Solaris !
          The bugs could be found, because Solaris has a multithreading
          X11 Server ! The development under linux does not show
          those reentrance-problems all the time.

        o 'componentResize' won't call glViewport direct.
          It will set a resize flag, and the next paint invocation
          will doing the resize-action ...

          o paint now invokes 'sDisplay' instead of invoking
          'display' direct.
          'sDisplay' has a semaphore, which avoids reentrance of
          the 'display' method !
          If 'sDisplay' has the semaphore, it will calls 'display' !
          Also ´sDisplay´ is a ´synchronized´ method,
          which will push the 2nd thread to the wait-list
          and notify the one after completion !

        o All demo's are now updated 
          (invokation of 'sDisplay' in run-method, instead of 'display')
          AND are WORKING well (as green- and native-threads !).

08. OKT 1997 (Version 1.0 beta1 )
        
        o Because of the lower described Major changes,
          we moved to version 1.0 !

        o Nearly *ALL* GL and GLU functions are supported.
          All JNI interfaces are no created by cross-compilation
          of manually fixed MESA Header-Files with the 
          cross-compiler C2J !
          C2J is a derivation of the BNF C-Parser delivered with
          the SUN's javaCC 0.6.1 !
          So, C2J (C2J.jj) can be compiled with jdk and javacc.
          C2J creates with Mesa's prototypes (a bit manipulated,
          so they will fit C2J) the needed java-prototypes AND
          the c-interface for the JNI-library !
          C2J is shipped within this package !
          The JNI-Interface just mapps the function.
          Neither the java class nor the JNI-Lib checks arguments !
          We perform a type mapping check to see if the
          suggested GL-types fits to JNI-types at GL-Initialisation !

        o The sun.awt.motiv.* and sun.awt.windows.* classes (java)
          are taken from Jogl V 0.7 (THANXS).
          We renamed 'em a bit, so NO naming confusion will occure,
          while using GL4Java AND Jogl in the same CLASSPATH !

        o GL4Java takes the Window-Handle direct from java
          (also taken from Jogl -- puhh).
          Because the use of the sun.* package, we do not know,
          if the platform specific classes do exist tommorow.
          SUN said "DO NOT USE THE sun.* classes ;-))".
          Anyway - we still can rewind the procedure to get the window handle.
          Ooops - I forgot - SO it's poosible now to have many frames
          with the same NAME (Yes we still using Frames) !

        o The Windows port was taken from Jogl V 0.7 (THANXS)
          But still not compiled ....

        o The function gljIsInit  is obsolete,
          use gljUse now !

        o All demos are updated AND ´wave´ is added !
          (Textures and GLU functions do work ;-))

        o Yes - We added some HTML documentation !


30. SEPT 1997 (Version 0.4)

        o created mklibs/mklib.<os> -> mklibs/mkslib.<os>
          to create * ONLY * shared librarys.
          This is a step for binary distribution !
          Also all symbols.mak.<os> uses for other shared librarys
          (MesaGL, m, MesaGLU, ...) * ONLY * the '-l<BaseLibName>'
          construct - so the created shared library will find the other 
          librarys via the LD_LIBRARY_PATH. E.g.: '-lMesaGL' !
          I must say i am not that sure about all the shared dynamic
          library stuff - but i testet it for solaris, ***
          - and it works. So we can download the 'libGL4Java.so' library
          for each target/os - check whether all libs are in
          the LD_LIBRARY_PATH - and it's done.
        o checked in demos if we can use 'Thread.yield()' while
          the thread-running-loop after direct re-rendering 
          (direct -> not via 'repaint' - via direct method call) !
          This works fine for: aix, solaris, ***!
        o setup the homepage at 
          <http://parallel.fh-bielefeld.de/pv/news/gl4java.html>.
          Some syntax fixes ;-) and * BINARY * support for
          solaris, *** !
        o Preparation for Win32.
          We just could do it with BC++ 5.0, instaed of using 
          gnuwin32 (cygnus32/mingw32).
          We tried the GNU compiler much, but we could not compile
          a OpenGL demo, because we could not link with the DLL´s :-(((.
        o removed the single concatenated list of a data structur,
          which holds the gl-context, win-handle.
          Added those handles in GLFrame (direct ;-).
          This is mainly don for Win32 support !
        o Added glViewport direct into GLFrame´s componentResize
          callback-function. So derivation´s do not need to do that !
        o Added glGetError and gljCheckGL, where the last performs
          a glGetError AND throws - catches an exception to print the
          source lines - where the check was performed
        o All glGet*v does resturn their values back to java - now ;-)
        o Code Clean Up : 
                * no more java actions in wrapper class
                * just a passthrough of data´s in native class
                * because of the non-data-parsing (speedup),
                  we will check all GL <-> JNI type mappings at startup once.
        o Added Jogl's sun.awt.motiv.* sun.awt.windows.* classes,
          to support window handle grabbing by java !
          This makes it possible to show the native method's the window
          handle, instead of using the window-title to identify.
          Now it is possible (theoretical) to use a canvas (like Jogl)
          as a OpenGL drawable component instead of a frame. BUT we believe
          that this is not that usefull - or is it ?!
        o GLFrame has the public method ´display´ (like glut),
          which will be called automatical by GLFrame's paint !
          So the derivation can easy use ´display´.
          Also paint is needed for grabbing the window-handle by java,
          befor GLFrame initializes the OpenGL-Context !
        o All demos and the 'dummyGL.java' are updated !

16. SEPT 1997 (Version 0.3)

        o added compiler FLAGS :
                o __CREATE_OWN_WINDOW__
                  NOT to use the original Java Window,
                  so a color-window created by our own will be used  !
                  This FLAG is actually NOT used for AIX, LINUX and SOLARIS !
        
14. SEPT 1997

        o spended very much time to port GL4Java to AIX 4.2.
        o CHANGES for AIX:
                o must use X11 lib in : '/usr/lpp/X11/lib'
                  - and so i used the GL lib in : '/usr/lpp/OpenGL/lib' either.
                  The X11 lib located in '/usr/lib' does not work with
                  the JDK :-(.
                o must use JDK 1.1.1 OR
                  JDK 1.1.2 without JIT (export JAVA_COMPILER=).
                  The JIT forces the program to exit.
                o must use the Java-Window itself, instead of
                  creating an own child-win !
                  Because the color's are not established in the 
                  own-win.
        o NOW GL4Java runs on AIX 4.2 :-)))
        o corrected skelleton 'demos/dummyGL.java'
        o modified GLFrame class - initialisation will be done 
          in the constructor. so the constructor takes now two more 
          arguments, the width and the height of the Window !

10. SEPT 1997 
        o taken some improvements from jogl v 0.5 for the
          X-Window System functions
        o renamed the java-package an the top-level directory to 'GL4Java'
          to avoid name-concurrency with other implementations
        o the actual top-level directory is now GL4Java,
          no more java-1.1.X and mklib* links were archived
          (to avoid confusion).
        o changed the 'javac' debug-flag '-g' to optimization '-O'
        o openOpenGL now greps the correct windows width and height
          from the JavaWin-Size
        o added gljResize to resize the GL-Window
          This is done with the native call XResizeWindow.
        o GLFrame is a ComponentListener,
          so a Resize _IS_ be tracked and passed to gljResize.
          If the java win is resized, the GL-Win is resized either !
          Your derived GLFrame-Method componentResized
          should call super.componentResized(e) to be shure
          that the super class makes the resize !
          Your derivation must NOT addComponentListener, because super does ..
        o improved cube demo with eyes control panel
        o actual dummyGL.java skelleton for your GL4Java portings ..

August/September 1997:
        
        o renamed the directory to OpenGL4Java
        o renamed the library to GL4Java ! 
        o created a new makefile 
          (now just one for the lib, and one for the demos)
        o make support about the symbols.mak.<machine> descriptor-files
          for linux(gl and mesa), solaris(mesa), aix
        o portet all 1.0.2 native calls to 1.1.X JNI calls
        o changed the naming convention to the strict convention
          of OpenGL. IE. glColor3f, gluPerspective, GL_DEPTH, etc.
        o renamed most of all java and c overheads in the wrapper
          functions - and passing all arguments straight to the
          OpenGL-Library.
        o renamed use and swap to gljUse and gljSwap,
          according to a correct naming convention 
          - with glj for gl java !
        o moved all gl-functions to OpenGLFrame for a more easier porting.
          no class instance prefix must be added !
          now gljInit creates the OpenGL initialisation,
          and gljIsInit checks for OpenGL initialisation !
        o added some glu* and gl* functions
        o added some demos in the directory demos
          also added a c-version for the demos to be able to
          compare the GL4Java with OpenGL.
        o added X-Error functions to be informed about X11 errors.
        o added more selective X procedures to get the true 
          java-window. this is done while porting GL4Java to aix.
          this porting is not successfully done.

July 24, 1997:

        Added genLists(), callList(), newList()
        Fixed a couple of minor bugs
