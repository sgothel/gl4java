SOURCE INSTALLATION
===================

  Prerequisites
  =============

  You must allready have the following installed:

    1.  Common

        (a) JDK >= 1.2

        (b) JavaCC >= 1.1

        (c) bash

        (d) GNU make

        (e) GNU tools

	(f) Java PNG archive (com.sixlegs.image.png)
		Copy the png.jar file into a CLASSPATH-directory, 
		e.g. <JAVA_HOME>/jre/lib/ext/png.jar !

		You can get a copy from the jausoft website also:

http://jausoft.goethel.de/Files/Java/1.1.X/GL4Java/binpkg/png-1.0a-jar.zip


    2.  UNIX/X11

        (a) ( GL + GLU ) or ( MesaGL + MesaGLU Version 2.4 or higher)
            We are looking for libGL.so AND libGLU.so in your library PATH, so
            please create a symbolic link from the Mesa libs, to the abstract
            one's !!
	    Please be sure to use a GLU Version >= 1.2 !!

	    Well, a GLU 1.2 version is recommended, e,g, SGI's one.
	    If you use Mesa's GLU version, you may have to add:
	    	-DGLU_VERSION_1_2
	    to your CFLAGS !

        (b) X11R6 (XFree86 works fine ;-) 3.6, or >= 4.0

        (c) Unix standard file-utilities (tar, gzip, ...)

        (d) LaTeX and LaTeX2Html (to generate the documentation)

    3.  Windows 32 (NT & 95)
        (a) MS-OpenGL and GLU library installed ! 
	    See if you have opengl32.dll AND glu32.dll 
	    installed in your library path 
	    (c:/winnt/system32 OR c:/windows/system)

        (b) WinZip (to extract zip and tar-gzip files), be sure to disable the
            option LF/CR conversion in TAR-Archives ! You can also use the jar
            command-line tool of the JDK for zip files !

        (c) Unix standard utilities (make, ksh (bash), tar ...) E.g. GNU-Win32
            Project from Cygnus[_1_1], make sure to have zip installed also !
        (d) LaTeX and LaTeX2Html (not testet - to generate the documentation)

        (e) For compiling GL4Java for the MS-JVM, be sure you have the new MS-
            JVM machine (build 3186) installed.


  Obtain GL4Java
  ===============

	Official TAR-BALL
	=================

Login as root (or any other), obtain the source archive for GL4Java.

http://jausoft.goethel.de/Files/Java/1.1.X/GL4Java/archive/

Copy the .tar.gz file to a directory such as /usr/local and cd to that
directory, then unpack the file:
   cd /usr/local	( or where ever you placed the file )
   gunzip GL4JavaX.Y.Z-Rn-src.tar.gz ; tar xvf GL4JavaX.Y.Z-Rn-src.tar
   gunzip GL4JavaX.Y.Z-Rn-doc.tar.gz ;
   tar xvf GL4JavaX.Y.Z-Rn-doc.tar (optional :-)

X is the major, Y the minor and Z the bugfix library version number, and Rn
(e.g. R2) is the release number, where no changes in the libs where made !

A new directory will be created called GL4Java.


	Anonymous CVS Access (Developer Version)
	========================================

This project's SourceForge CVS repository can be checked out through anonymous
(pserver) CVS with the following instruction set. 
The module you wish to check out must be specified as the modulename. 
When prompted for a password for anonymous, simply press the Enter key. 

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.GL4Java.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/GL4Java login 
 
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.GL4Java.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/GL4Java co GL4Java 

Updates from within the module's directory do not need the -d parameter.



  Compilation
  ===========

	UNICEs and WINDOWs users
	=========================

Go to the directory GL4Java, 
which is the root-directory of GL4Java 
- so we stay here for the following procedures !

You will see some 'symbols.mak.<machine>' files. 
Choose the right 'symbols.mak.<machine>' file, or create one. 
Edit your choosen or created 'symbols.mak.<machine>', 
so it will fit to your OS configuration - mind all macros !

Copy the file 'symbols.mak.<your-machine>' to 'symbols.mak',
a symbolic link for unices is recomended.

The created lib will be copied to 'HOME_LIB_DIR' by automatic 
(via tar - symbolic links are still alive ;-) !

All compiled java class files and the are copied into the directory
'DEST_CLASSES_DIR' !
This class-copy procedure can be forced later with the make call:
	´make classcpy´.
The gl4java.jar archive is generated in the directory 'DEST_CLASSES_DIR' also.

Because GL4Java supports Netscape's JVM & JNI, 
we do try to ask for a privilege to run native DLL's. 
Because this requested privilege - the 'netscape' security-classes are
delivered in the file ´capsapi_classes.zip´ which is used in the JAVAC macro
definition in symbols.mak.


	UNICEs users
	============

Do not forget to add your 'HOME_LIB_DIR' (set in symbols.mak) 
to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH !

Next create the library, class-files and all is needed with (for Unix/X11):
    make x11

The Unix makefile-action does the complete creation :-) 

The shared libraries are moved to the HOME_LIB_DIR (see above) 
or copied with the "-a" option to keep the symbolic links alive !

	WINDOWs users
	==============

Next create the class-files and all preparations with (Win32):
    make w32

The Windows makefile-action only creates the tool (gljni) and all Java classes
and C-wrappers. An additional C compiler invocation must be done.

To compile GL4Java, we still use MS Visual C++ 6.0 ! We also assume that
Windows is installed under c:/WIN_NT ! The compiler flags are set to Pentium
Pro (686 / PII) with the optimizimg Intel compiler !
Also Java2 SDK is installed under c:/java2 ! Also MS Java SDK is installed
under c:/MSJAVASDK !
Please check all location in the makefile !

  1.  If you have installed cygwin32 and it's bash and make, etc... AND set it
      up very well (CLASSPATH, PATH, ...) you can invoke the makefile_b with
      make w32 to create all java-depended stuff and the C-wrappers.

  2.  Befor going any further, check if the files opengl32.dll glu.dll_a,
      glu32.dll exist in c:/WIN_NT/system32 OR c:/windows/system ! IF not get
      MS-OpenGL Lib (opengl32.dll, glu32.dll) !

  3.  Go with the Explorer to the directory Win32VC6 and open the workspace
      Win32VC6.dsw !

  4.  Now, you should fix some option in the project file, we used:
      The order of this path is important !
      INCLUDEPATH:
      		  c:/projects/java-1.1.X/GL4Java/CClassHeaders; \
      		  c:/projects/java-1.1.X/GL4Java/CNativeCode; \
      		  c:/java2/include; \
      		  c:/java2/include/windows \
      		  <the MSVC60 SDK PATH's ...>
      LIBPATH:
      		  c:/WIN_NT/system32; \
      		  <the MSVC60 SDK PATH's ...>
      WHERE: Java2 is installed under c:/java2 GL4Java is installed under d:/
      projects/java-1.1.X/GL4Java

  5.  Now just compile each project and the targets are placed in the lib
      directory !

  6.  Copy the generated dll's (in the libs-directory) to your windows system32
      directory, or (better) to your /java2/jre/bin directory .

	UNICEs and WINDOWs users
	=========================

If all goes well, just type e.g.: 
	'java gl4java.GLContext -info'

This will just test the bindings and gives you some informations !


Next create the demos with.
   cd demos
   make

If all goes well, just type e.g.: 
	'java glDemosCvs' 

in this directory, 
and you should see a demo manager for all the GL4Java demos we have written.

You can also compare the totally native glut version against the java version.
The glut versions do exist in the demos path also (under native).
