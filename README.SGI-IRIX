va2v122 trying setting the environment variable
JAVA_OPENGL_NATIVE when running under -native.

This preloads the OpenGL libraries and the underlying kernel execution
vehicles are initialized right and work correctly under pthreads. 

------------------

otherwise you may get a segmentation fault !
