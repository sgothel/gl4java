With GL4Java Version 2.1.0 Release 0, 
GL4Java do supports the MS-JVM plattform,
which means GL4Java-Applets runs under the MS InternetExplorer >= 4.0 !

Please read INSTALL.txt first !

Prerequisites
==============

Be sure to have:

The new MS-JVM machine (build 3186) installed:

	Microsoft (R) VM for Java, 5.0 Release 5.0.0.3186

(The following version does NOT Work:
	Microsoft (R) VM for Java (tm), 4.0 Release 4.79.0.2424)

You can get it from the Microsoft-Webside's: 
	http://www.microsoft.com/java/
	http://www.microsoft.com/java/vm/dl_vm40.htm

Extracted the gl4java.jar, gl4java-glutfonts.jar AND png.jar archive 
(with WinZip or the jar command-line-tool)
to: C:\WINDOWS\Java\TRUSTLIB,
so you have the new directories:

		  C:\WINDOWS\Java\TRUSTLIB\com\sixlegs
		  C:\WINDOWS\Java\TRUSTLIB\gl4java
		  C:\WINDOWS\Java\TRUSTLIB\sun
		  C:\WINDOWS\Java\TRUSTLIB\META-INF

Delete the new directory C:\WINDOWS\Java\TRUSTLIB\META-INF !

Then copy the native library (DLL) GL4JavaGljMSJDirect.dll
to C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM[32]

		  C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\GL4JavaGljMSJDirect.dll (WINNT)

		  or

		  C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\GL4JavaGljMSJDirect.dll   (WIN9X)


Notes:
======

Be sure to have a MS-JVM installed on your system,
e.g. the one installed within MS-IE 4.0 !

Applets, Security:
======================================
  Because now you have installed the GL4Java system on your local
  system. All Applet's using GL4Java can run !
  
  If not - please try to modify your MS-IE security setup !

This Port to the MS-JVM is written by Ron Cemer
and merged into the GL4Java official source tree by Sven Goethel.

TODO:
=====

Support a better window update for the GL4Java OpenGL windows !

Support query Double-Buffer and STEREO, like X11 !

An Easy Installation Tool :-) That's Ron's sweating either.
