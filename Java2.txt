Since GL4Java Version 2.0.0 Release 1, 
GL4Java do supports the Java2 plattform !

Since GL4Java Version 2.7.1, 
GL4Java do supports the privileges of the extension mechanism !

Please read INSTALL.txt first !

You may have many Java2 installation's, e.g.:

	under unix, e.g.:

	/jdk1.3
	/usr/lib/jre1.3

	or under window, e.g.:

	c:/jdk1.3
	c:/Programme/JavaSoft/JRE

If you want to use both java installations,
you have to install it in both directories !

E.g. the first one is for you development usage,
where the secound one is for your java jre 1.3 plugin usage
within your web browser.

If you use the JRE >= 1.3 plugin within you Web-Browser or appletviewer to:

	- Install GL4Java

	- Run the demo's from the GL4Java Website

you must add privileges to your 

	jre/lib/security/java.policy

file, to install GL4Java with the GL4Java Installer !

Here are the privileges for this purpose (installation only):

	http://www.jausoft.com/Files/Java/1.1.X/GL4Java/Installer/java.policy


Prerequisites
==============

Be sure to have:

		  ./jre/lib/ext/gl4java.jar	      : for Java2 or JRE
		  ./jre/lib/ext/gl4java-glutfonts.jar : for Java2 or JRE
	          ./jre/lib/ext/png.jar          : for Java2 or JRE 

		  For Windows32: Java2-Plug-In, Java2, JRE (prefered)

			  c:/windows/system/GL4JavaGljMSJDirect.dll
			  c:/windows/system/GL4JavaJauGljJNI.dll
			  c:/windows/system/GL4JavaJauGljJNI12.dll
			  c:/windows/system/GL4JavaJauGljJNI13.dll

		  or 

			  ./jre/bin/GL4JavaGljMSJDirect.dll
			  ./jre/bin/GL4JavaJauGljJNI.dll
			  ./jre/bin/GL4JavaJauGljJNI12.dll
			  ./jre/bin/GL4JavaJauGljJNI13.dll

		  For Unix: Java2-Plug-In, Java2, JRE (prefered)

			  /usr/lib/libGL4JavaJauGljJNI.so*
			  /usr/lib/libGL4JavaJauGljJNI12.so*
			  /usr/lib/libGL4JavaJauGljJNI13.so*

		  or

			  ./jre/lib/<machine>/libGL4JavaJauGljJNI.so*
			  ./jre/lib/<machine>/libGL4JavaJauGljJNI12.so*
			  ./jre/lib/<machine>/libGL4JavaJauGljJNI13.so*

			  * => all symbolic links and the file itself,
			       use "cp -a" to keep the symbolic links alive !

			  Be sure to copy the linked lib-files also !

			  After installation you may do a "ldconfig" 
			  call as root !


Java2-Plug-In, Appletviewer, Security:
======================================
  Since GL4Java 2.7.1, the gl4java.jar file must resides within 
  the jre/lib/ext directory. In this case no special policy
  is needed for use GL4Java and you can skip this chapter !!

  For GL4Java <= 2.7.0 only:

  To allow JAVA2's appletviewer and Plug-In using JNI native libs,
  just look at GL4Java/demo/Java2Applet.bat 
  (You have to change the GL4Java.policy file) !

  You can - of course - use your 'policytool',
  which is shipped with JAVA2 !

  You can check JAVA2-Plug-In with the Java-Applets-Html-File's
	demos/glLogoCvsAppletJ2P.html
	demos/glOlympicCvsAppletJ2P.html
	demos/testTextPPM1J2P.html

  To use the demo Applets for Java2-Plug-In from www.jausoft.com,
  please add the following lines to your java.policy file:

grant codeBase "http://www.jausoft.com/Files/Java/1.1.X/GL4Java/demos/-" {
  permission java.security.AllPermission;
};


TODO:

Test other plattforms :-)
