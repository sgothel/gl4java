/**
*  Implements the Virtual Sphere algorithm for 3D rotation using a 2D input device.
*  See paper "A Study in Interactive 3-D Rotation Using 2-D Control Devices" by
*  Michael Chen, S. Joy Mountford and Abigail Sellen published in the ACM Siggraph '88
*  proceedings (Volume 22, Number 4, August 1988) for more detail.  The code here
*  provides a much simpler implementation than that described in the paper.
*  This is also known by as the "virtual track ball" or "cue ball" interface.
