<br>
!!! The original demos are ported by Ron Cemer !!!  <br>
<br>
I have made some changes, which i described below !<br>
<br>
Many THANXS to Ron Cemer !!!!!!!!! <br>

This page contains OpenGL demos, originally
written in C, which have been ported to Java and
<br>modified to use the GL4Java library.
<p>Since the source code is readily available for these demos, they could
serve as a great starting point
<br>for aspiring Java applet programmers who may or may not have experience
with OpenGL.&nbsp; You DO
<br>need to know Java in order to understand what is going on.&nbsp; Additionally,
I STRONGLY recommend
<br>that you buy the "OpenGL Programmer's Guide" (often called the "Red
Book") if you plan to do
<br>OpenGL programming, whether for C, Java or any other language.
<p>*** YOU MUST INSTALL THE GL4JAVA LIBRARIES BEFORE RUNNING THE DEMOS
***
<br>If you haven't installed the GL4Java libraries yet, go do that first,
then come back here and enjoy!
<p>Here are the demos:

I have only added a new Class, to support a simple <br>
customizing feature to these Applets !  <br>
<br>
The new Class is called "gl4java.applet.SimpleGLAnimApplet1", <br>
and it supports to customize the frame/secounds (fps) value <br>
and the refresh technique - both for animations !  <br>
This new Class is now part of the GL4Java distribution,
but is added here for portability !<br>
<br>
I removed the endless refresh technique from Ron, <br>
so that the more portable "repaint" technique is used as default.  <br>
You can switch this off, like the "fps-sleep" delay ...  <br>
But you should know, what you are doing, e.g. be sure to have a <br>
native thread JVM (MS-IE, and unix JVM's runs well with it) !  <br>
<br>
I removed the cab-files, and the jar-files also, <br>
because it looks too confusing and too overdriven for me. <br>
If you use MS-IE 4.0, be sure to have the new <br>
MS-JVM machine (build 3186) installed ! <br>
