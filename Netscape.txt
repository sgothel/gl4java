With GL4Java Version 2.0.1 Release 2, 
GL4Java do supports the Netscape 4.5 Win32-JVM and Unix plattform !

<Version 2.0.0 Release 1 and Version 2.0.1 Release 1
 has a bug within the capabilities call and the JAR package >

Please read INSTALL.txt first !

WINDOW 95/98/NT:
=================

Be sure to have:

		  ./Netcape/Communicator/Program/Java/classes/png.jar
		  ./Netcape/Communicator/Program/Java/classes/gl4java.jar
		  ./Netcape/Communicator/Program/Java/classes/gl4java-glutfonts.jar

		  ./Netcape/Communicator/Program/Java/bin/GL4JavaJauGljJNI.dll
		  ./Netcape/Communicator/Program/Java/bin/GL4JavaJauGljJNI12.dll
		  ./Netcape/Communicator/Program/Java/bin/GL4JavaJauGljJNI13.dll


UNIX (Linux/Solaris/...):
=========================

Be sure to have:

		  /opt/netscape/java/classes/gl4java-glutfonts.jar
		  /opt/netscape/java/classes/png.jar

The nativ libraries must be installed on a directory,
which is in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment !!
E.g.:
		/usr/lib/libGL4JavaJauGljJNI.so*
		/usr/lib/libGL4JavaJauGljJNI12.so*
		/usr/lib/libGL4JavaJauGljJNI13.so*

All symbolic links and the file itself,
use "cp -a" to keep the symbolic links alive !

Also you should be sure to have a CLASSPATH for Netscape set 
like this:
	CLASSPATH=/opt/netscape/java/classes:.
	for i in /opt/netscape/java/classes/*.jar ; do
		CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$i
	done
	echo $CLASSPATH
	export CLASSPATH

or just make the default whith:

	CLASSPATH=
	export CLASSPATH

Applets/Security:
======================
You can check Netscape with the Java-Applets-Html-File's
	demos/glLogoCvsApplet.html
	demos/glOlympicCvsApplet.html
	demos/testTextPPM1.html (copy swingall.jar of Swing1.1 to 
		                 ./Netcape/Communicator/Program/Java/classes )

You will be asked to grant the asked privilege,
so trust GL4Java and say yes !

TODO:
=====

Test other plattforms :-)
