<font size=+1>The Pre-GL4Java OpenGL Language Mappings</font></h2></center>

<p><br><b><i>01/1996</i></b></center>

<p>The OpenGL interface for Java work was started by Leo Chan<a href="ftp://ftp.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/pub/software/meta/OpenGL4java.html">
[ftp://ftp.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/pub/software/meta/OpenGL4java.html]</a>.
<br>He implemented the library for Java 1.0.2 with its pre JNI native mechanism.
<br>The native and the java glue for OpenGL was written by hand and so,
it wasn't complete.

<p><b><i>1997</i></b></center>

<p>Leo Chan's works was continued by Adam King[<a href="http://www.magma.ca/%7Eaking/java">OpenGL4Java</a>].
<br>This version was able to be compiled with Java 1.1 and the
<br>OpenGL-Rendering is done in the callers Java-Frame.
<br>The native and java glue for OpenGL was still implemented by hand and
used the pre JNI mechanism.

<p><b><i>(about) 04/1997 - 12/1997</i></b></center>

<p>Tommy Reilly[<a href="http://www.pajato.com/jogl">Jogl</a>] participated
to Adam King's work and the project's title changed to Jogl. Jogl's big
points lies in it's
<br>powerfull autoconfig and in it's improved X-Window System functions
- so mostly all Unices are supported. Another point is
<br>the Win32 support. Sources and a precompiled dll were distributed.
<br>Jogl uses the new Java 1.1 JNI mechnism, the native and java glue for
OpenGL was still implemented by hand.
<br>Like the prerequisite versions, Jogl's API differs from the "C" OpenGL
naming convention.

<p><b><i>03/1997 - Today</i></b></center>

<p><a href="http://www.jausoft.com/gl4java/">GL4Java</a> is based upon
Leo Chan's work and is developed parallel to Jogl.
<br>It uses - as Jogl does - the JDK 1.1. JNI mechanism.
<br>After getting in touch with Tommy Reilly, Jogl and GL4Java shared a
few ressources.
<br>The further development of Jogl&nbsp; stops, so GL4Java is the only
active remaining successor of the first original approach.
<br>GL4Java extends / differs from all the above implementations:
<ul>
<li>
Using the "C" OpenGL API / naming convention</li>

<li>
Using a compiler to create the complete OpenGL/GLU native and java glue
code</li>

<li>
Is Netscape &amp; MS-IE Browser enabled.</li>

<li>
...</li>
</ul>
