<ul>
<li>
Magician ( -> <a href="http://arcana.symbolstone.org/products/magician/">http://arcana.symbolstone.org/products/magician/</a>
)</li>

<p><br>Magician is a commercial closed source product, and it is therefor
a proprietary product ( -> GNU ).
<p>It has a nice documentation. People who has switched from Magician to
GL4Java,
<br>because its Magician's proprietary approach, missed nothing, but the
open source standard.
<p>Well, I gave Magician no try, because of the license - thats it.
<p>Ron Cemer, a GL4Java participant, just stated about the Magician approach,
<br>that he is not willing to spend time and energy in bug finding for
an closed and proprietary product.
<br>So do I.
<p>1st Release on 09/1997.
