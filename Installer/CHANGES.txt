-----------------
TOP  = new
DOWN = old
-----------------

Dezember 11, 2001 (Version 2.82):
	o Installer added SunOS intel x86 support (jau)
	o little bugfixes (jau)

Dezember 6, 2001 (Version 2.07):

	o The Installer now installs also:
		- GLF Fonts
		- The native libraries under JAVA_HOME/lib/<arch>, or
		  JAVA_HOME/bin ! (checks where java.dll or libjava.so, resides)

Dezember 31, 2000 (Version 2.06a):

	- Added a ProgressBar to the main Applet Panel !
	  Thanxs to Andrea Fasce for his Idea of the overloaded
	  BufferedInputStream, which counts the read bytes !

	- Removed the GLVendor stuff for Unices,
	  because it is no more needed since a long time.

	- Changed the Background color ;-)

Dezember 28, 2000 (Version 2.05c):

	- Fixed security bug, while fetching the property "java.home" !

November 21, 2000 (Version 2.05b):

	- Added J2RE (Java2 JRE) and Java 1.1 classpath support !
	  Now the installer will find and - if needed - generates the
	  lib/ext directory relative to the java.home path !

November 18, 2000 (Version 2.05):

	- Added needed privileges to the directory checking methods
	  in MachineCtrl.java !

	- Added Focus-Lost Event to the both 
	  directory input fields !

	  So the just entered path is checked,
	  even if you just leave the input-field with tab
	  or a mouse click to the nowwhere .. 

	- If the path is not correct, the focus to the input-field
	  is requested !

August 19, 2000 (Version 2.04):

	- Improved the standalone installation.
		- The Installer has now its own binpkg zip archiv, 
		  to be downloaded !
		- Unix and Dos startscripts are supported !
		- All needed Files for the installation procedure
		  are fetched from the jausoft website, 
		  during the installation, if they does not exist localy !

	- Added machine info printouts ...

June 08, 2000 (Version 2.03):

	- Adding Linux-PowerPC
	- Respecting GL4Java 2.4.0, only one generic GL vendor exists :)
	- If no JVM vendor can be fetched, a SUN-JVM compatible one
	  is expected.

April 01, 2000 (Version 2.02):

	- Adding Sun-JVM 1.1.X & Sun-Java2 support for the
		- appletviewer/hotjava-browser/Java2-PlugIn
		- application (java -cp GL4JInst.jar GL4JInst)

        - Now it is possible, to bundle the directories:
		./Installer
		./binpkg
	  together - to run the installer as a standalone application !

Dezember 07, 1999 (Version 2.00 - Sven Goethel):

	Starting integrating the Installer to the GL4Java Homepage !

	This version 2.00 is based upon the original version 1.05,
	by Ron Cemer !

	- Splitting the class GL4JInst into:
		GL4JInst
		MachineCtrl
		FilelistOS (interface for:)
			FilelistJavaArchiv
			FilelistJavaClasses
			FilelistLinuxI386GlibcMesaNVidia
			FilelistLinuxI386GlibcMesaSoft
			FilelistWin32I386
			FilelistWin95I386OpenGL
		FilelistTool
		FileTool

	  This is done in the nature to achive the know-how
	  of Ron's code, so I had to do a little clean-up ;-)

	- The Applet-Tag parameter is *not* supported know !

	- The archive files are fetched directly
	  out of the ../binpkg directory.
	  The archive files are created with the makefile 
	  of GL4Java
