To generate a copy of the distributed files (files which should be deployed on
a web server), run the following batch file (Win32 only):
    makedist (path)
where (path) is replaced by the path to a directory where the files are to be
copied.  Only the files required to deploy the installer on a web server will
be copied to this directory.  Be careful, though, since it does copy some HTML
files.  Any existing HTML files of the same name(s) in the target directory
could be wiped out by this batch file.  For safety's sake, it's probably best
to copy the files to an empty directory first, instead of a directory on a
live web server.

For Netscape, there is an included x509.crt file, which must be imported into
Netscape's certificate database by the user.  Netscape comes pre-configured to
know the correct MIME type for this file when loading it from local disk.
There is, however, a special requirement when delivering the x509.crt via a
web server.  The MIME type for ".crt" files must be set properly.  Some web
servers come configured correctly for ".crt" files by default.  For Apache web
server, for example, you will need to add the following line to
/etc/mime.types if isn't already there:
    application/x-x509-ca-cert      crt
In order for the change to take effect, you may need to reboot, or at least
stop and restart the web server.

The GL4Java installer can read the files to be installed from zip files on the
web server (the GL4JLibs*.zip files that are generated by running libarc.bat),
or straight from a directory on the web server.  By default, the GL4Java
installer reads from GL4JLibs*.zip files on the web server.

You can change the the source for these files to a subdirectory of your
choosing (on the web server) by making the changes listed below.  Note that
"mysource" should be replaced with the name of a subdirectory into which
the GL4JLibs*.zip files have been extracted.  For example, if you wanted to
copy files from a directory on the web server, you could make a subdirectory
named "libs", then change to that directory and unzip the GL4JLibs*.zip files
from there.

*** IMPORTANT ***  After unzipping under Unix, you must be sure that all
directories under the libs directory are mode 755 in order for the web server
to be able to read from them.  Change to the newly created "libs" directory
(or whatever you called it), and enter the following commands EXACTLY as
shown here:
    for i in `find . -type d -print`
    do
        chmod 755 $i
    done

Keep in mind that when you are copying from a directory, the files are not
compressed so they will take longer to download via modem.  For this reason,
it is highly recommended that you use the supplied zip files.

Here are the changes to the html files which are required in order to make the
GL4Java installer read from a sudirectory (remember to replace mysource with
the name of your subdirectory which contains the extracted GL4JLibs*.zip
files).
